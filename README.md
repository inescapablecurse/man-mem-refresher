# man-mem-refresher
ElectronJS based reminder app which reminds you to refresh your knowledge on certain skills. Aids in converting your knowledge in your short term memory into long term memory. 

The main idea behind this app is to use a exponentially increasing interval between refresher sessions. For example it will remind you when 1 day later after you acquire knowledge in a certain field. Subsequently it will remind you 2days later to refresh your memory on that. The next reminder will be 4 days later and so on in a exponential revision schedule.

The whole idea is repeat, repeat and repeat until whichever knowledge you want to gain is ingrained into your long term memory.
